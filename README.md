## DEVELOPMENTAL STRUCTURE AND PROCESS:
In the first month, we will initiate project planning. Our primary focus will be on outlining
project goals and requirements. Additionally, we will conduct research to determine the
languages we need to use, dedicating time to learning these languages extensively.
Moving into the second month, we will commence development activities. The initial steps
involve completing the API and database setup, followed by the design phase for both the web and
mobile interfaces. Simultaneously, we will develop the logical structure of the application. As we transition into the third month, our main objective will be to connect the API and resolve
any issues or bugs identified during testing. This phase is crucial to ensure the app's functionality
is seamless and that it meets our planned objectives. By the end of the third month, our goal is
to have a fully functional and user-friendly application.
